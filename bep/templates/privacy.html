        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>Effective date: February 26, 2025</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and user
            analytics when you use this website and the choices you have associated with that data. The Digital Humanities
            Innovation Lab at Simon Fraser University operates the website at
            <a target="_blank" href="{% url 'home' %}">{{ request.build_absolute_uri }}</a>. The website has no other addresses.
        </p>
        <p>We collect different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve the website. The data
            collected by the website will be stored on computers located at Simon Fraser University, in Burnaby, British
            Columbia, Canada. If you are located outside Canada and choose to provide information to us, please note that we
            transfer the data to Canada and process it there.</p>
        <p>While using the website, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can
            be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). This information will only be collected by request. You
            are not required to provide this information to use the website. Personally identifiable information may
            include, but is not limited to email address and first name and last name.</p>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>This website does not allow anyone other than designated administrators to publish content, such as comments or
            uploaded images. We may accept comments on individual pages, but those comments will not be made public until an
            administrator approves and publishes each one.</p>
        <p>This website does not hotlink images, videos, or other content from other sites.</p>
        <p>This website does not use fonts or icons from third-party servers which could be used to track users.</p>
        <h2>Additional Software</h2>
        <p>This website does not load software in your web browser that serves any purpose beyond displaying the website and
            its assets&#8212;meaning it does not use your user agent to mine cryptocurrency, for example.</p>
        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>This website uses encryption provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digicert.com/">DigiCert</a>, and all requests not using encryption are redirected to
            the equivalent encrypted page. This encryption prevents anyone between your web browser and the web server (such
            as your Internet service provider) from seeing details about what was requested or what the resulting page
            contains.</p>
        <h2>More Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
